General Description

CUNY Fellowship in the Behavioral Sciences


The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21. The fellow will work in collaboration with partner CUNY schools and the SPI Project Manager to develop and implement projects that address barriers to student engagement, retention, and success. Planned projects include scaling multi-year interventions through Blackboard, emails, and text messages.

Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:
Conduct student data extraction and analysis (including, but not limited to, academic records, enrollment data, Blackboard analytics, and student experience survey results)
Analyze the effectiveness of SPI interventions and their impact on retention and persistence (including, but not limited to, graduation rates and transfer rates)
Analyze FAFSA renewal rates of student populations in participating senior colleges and community colleges in FAFSA Renewal campaigns
Use statistical programs such as R, SPSS, and Stata to develop and prepare data for sharing with project partners
Extract, clean, and manage data from multiple sources
Respond to ad hoc requests for information and data
Participate in weekly/biweekly conference calls to discuss project development and implementation
Produce briefings, progress reports, and materials for project evaluation based on data; present materials to CUNY staff

Seek Understanding: We are lifelong students who want to understand the world around us. We are curious to understand our readers, how we get better at our own disciplines and how we can work better together. This means we are active listeners, information hunters and empathetic.

Explain Why: Because we seek to understand, we value the importance of explaining our ideas and our understanding. This means we are constructively candid, sharing our perspectives and the thought process behind it. And then learning from the conversation that ensues. We are all teachers and students, helping each other grow.

Solve Things: We love to solve things, whether they are our own problems, our readers problems or our colleagues problems. While we often can solve problems on our own, we believe our best results come out when we solve them together.

Get It Done: We are passionate about getting things done. Whether it is our own individual work or teamwork, our instinct is to forge a path forward and learn as we go. This means we continually focus on how to turn work into achievable chunks, communicate those effectively to the team and efficiently execute against them.

Make It Better: We aren’t satisfied with perpetuating the status quo. We’re always looking forward. We live to change the world around us for the better, making a difference in our own lives and our readers’ lives. If we are being ambitious enough, this means that we will both fail and succeed and we take pride in owning both of those outcomes as long as we are learning.

Preferred Qualifications


As a member of Business Intelligence
team, you will be responsible for managing stakeholders, collecting
requirements, and performing analytics with a complex and granular financial
data set. Your primary focus will be working with business stakeholders to
understand their needs and deliver results that are timely, accurate and relevant.
In this position, you will play a key role in defining how ODC analyzes, talks
about, and views key business performance metrics. You will have the
opportunity to learn a exciting industry, work with new technologies, and grow
with the business.

You’ll need to combine
your ability in relationship building with analytical, data presentation, and
project management skills, whilst working with many functions across the Oracle
Data Cloud family, including sales, finance, marketing, and product teams, all
the way up to the executive team. You’ll need to know what data you have at
your fingertips and be able to think how you can use it to help the person in
front of you. Every day you will be playing a key role in helping Oracle Data
Cloud operate more efficiently and effectively.
Primary Responsibilities:

Front-line
Support: Be the first port of call for any queries that come into the
team. Answer the ones you can and help guide the ones you can’t to the right
people.

Requirements
Gathering: Find out today’s burning questions and work out how we can
answer them. Work out tomorrow’s questions before they’ve been asked and keep
us ahead of the game.

Report
Delivery: Make sure that the stakeholders that use our data get it when
they need it, in a form that makes sense to them. Be able to set expectations
around when they’ll receive it and respond to questions about it once they have
it.

Data
Curation: Who owns this account? Which product line is this SKU on? Which
team is that sales person on? You may not know, but you know who to ask, and
you know how to use the tools to record it.

End-User Training:
Ensure that our customers know what tools they have at their
disposal, and what they can do when they have them.

Ad Hoc
Analysis: Not every piece of work needs to be a multi-sprint project
involving a cast of thousands. Sometimes someone just needs an answer now to a
question that they’ll never need to ask again. Whether it’s done in Excel, SQL,
or the back of a napkin, just get it done.
Skills & Qualifications:

Experience: At least
4 years’ experience in a role that includes finance, sales or business analysis.
Must know your way round an Excel spreadsheet. SQL would be useful, and VBA a
bonus. Knowledge of data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI wouldn’t
go amiss either.

Relationship
Builder: Everyone’s new best friend. Works well in team efforts,
building trust and respecting boundaries. Reads situational dynamics and
responds appropriately. Influences rather than directs.

Analytical: Good with numbers. Never
loses a decimal place. Knows how many zeroes there are in half a billion.
Calculates compound interest in their sleep.

Versatility: Are you
more of a data person, or a people person? The answer is “both” – you think
like a sales person, but you feel like an analyst, and then tomorrow you’ll
talk like tech and walk like marketing. Can crunch numbers and tell captivating
stories, all with one arm tied behind your back.

Honesty
& Integrity: Does not cut corners ethically; earns trust and does the right
thing. If people don’t trust us, they don’t trust our data, and if they don’t
trust our data then what have we got left?

Company Description
Our history began in 1919 when Quinn Company supplied the Killifer Disc and Holt Tractor to the Fresno area farmers in their quest to develop the great San Joaquin Valley into the worlds richest agricultural region. In 1925, when Holt and Best Tractor Company merged to form Caterpillar Tractor Co. (now Caterpillar Inc.), Quinn became its dealer in the Fresno and Madera County area. Since then, we have expanded through acquisitions and grown along with the economy of California.

Now in our fourth generation of family ownership, our operations span fifteen counties throughout central and southern California, including Arizona. Quinn now has 22 locations from Salinas to Foothill Ranch with more than 1200 employees to serve our customers.

We are proud of the success we have built with the help of our customers, our employees and Caterpillar.

About Us

Pinto is a smarter food data platform, designed for the needs of today's consumers in the world of personalized diet. To do this, we're rapidly bringing the world of food online and making it personalized across every dietary need and preference — everything from general diets like Vegan, Paleo, Keto, Heart Health, and Mediterranean, to the long tail of ingredient and allergen considerations like Lactose Free, Gluten Free, Nut Free, and No Added Sugars. Over 40% of Americans now follow a specific dietary eating pattern, and our data platform is organizing the world of food at scale with partners that include Whole Foods and Kroger.

For businesses, we work with industry partners (retail/CPG) to 1) rapidly digitize large product inventories and 2) organize these inventories across every granular need and preference that matters to a modern consumer — from every allergen and intolerance to the long tail of diets (like Paleo, Gluten-Free, Keto, etc.), conditions, certifications, nutrition preferences and much more.

Current retail partners include Whole Foods, Kroger, and more. Learn more about Pinto and the technologies we power: http://business.pinto.co

At Vesta Healthcare, we enable people with personal assistance to thrive at home, in their community by assuring the people they rely on, their caregivers, have the resources, data, and support they need. We achieve this through a combination of analytics, technology, services, and deep healthcare expertise. Our analytics help identify and target the right people and populations. Our technology creates real-time connectivity and actionable data out of observations. Our services connect to real people who can help when needs arise, and our healthcare expertise helps us understand how we create value for both payers and providers.

Our program monitors in real-time, identifying issues before they become health events, and helping connect those in need with those who can help via technologies such as video, chat, and telephone. Our technology platform includes home-based mobile applications, a clinical dashboard, and data analytics on data not previously available to health professionals. We are disrupting a $109 billion industry and have just closed our latest funding round with a blue-chip list of investors.

We're looking to add to our team of experts who care deeply about our mission.

Our team is passionate, driven, collaborative, intellectually curious, and excited about the opportunity to transform our healthcare system. We're inspired by caregivers and seek to create a platform that recognizes, utilizes and supports the vital role they play. We strive to continuously learn, explore, experiment and achieve results. We are here to improve the quality of life for caregivers and care recipients, allowing them to focus on the important things (like going to the mall with their grandkids)

A data management/analyst who enjoys working with healthcare data so as to support clinicians, software developers, and senior leadership with the information and self help tools they need to succeed in growing our business.

We love to problem-solve creatively while keeping a sharp focus on the important drivers of the business.
We prioritize relentlessly to ensure that whatever we're working on is vital to our business' growth
We’re results-focused, but not afraid of failure as we lean into change and pursue our goals.
We’re open to new ideas and not afraid to break the status quo
